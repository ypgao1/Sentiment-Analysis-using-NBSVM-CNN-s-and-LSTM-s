# imdb-sentiment-analysis
This project is to implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of a classifier that first scales feature vectors by a naive bayes log count ratio before using a linear classifier (SVM was chosen here but others ie logistic regression can also be used).  This classifier, NBSVM, comes from a paper [Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P12-2018.pdf) and [repo](https://github.com/sidaw/nbsvm)  by Sida Wang and Christopher D. Manning. 

Although it is widely acknowledged in research, (over 900 citations), it's not too well known amongst data science practitioners. FastAI's creator Jeremy Howard has wrote about it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/nb-svm-strong-linear-baseline) but there was a time bottleneck in his implementation. This implementation has fixed the bottleneck (from >1hr to a few seconds at most) as well as using an Linear SVM classifier for speed.
